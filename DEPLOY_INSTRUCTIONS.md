# Manual Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **Code Changes Complete**: Admin panel improvements are ready
✅ **Local Commit**: Changes committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub
✅ **Files Updated**: 
- `client/src/pages/admin.tsx` - Added bilingual support and fixed disconnect button
- `client/src/components/admin/deployment-management.tsx` - Enhanced with environment selection
- `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md` - Comprehensive deployment documentation

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
# In your terminal, navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/memopyk-project

# Push the committed changes
git push origin main --force
```

### 2. Monitor Coolify Deployment
After pushing to GitHub, Coolify will automatically:
- Detect the new commit
- Pull the updated code
- Run the build command: `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
- Deploy to new.memopyk.com

### 3. Verify Deployment
Once deployed, check:
- **Language Switching**: Visit admin panel and verify FR/EN buttons are visible in header
- **Disconnect Button**: Verify the button is now visible (cream color on navy background)
- **Deployment Panel**: Check the enhanced environment selection features

## Expected Results
- **Admin Panel**: Now fully bilingual with visible language toggle
- **Disconnect Button**: Fixed styling - no longer white on white
- **Deployment Management**: Enhanced with staging/production environment selection
- **Build Process**: Using verified working configuration

## Verification URLs
- **Admin Panel**: https://new.memopyk.com/admin
- **Password**: memopyk2025admin
- **Public Site**: https://new.memopyk.com

## Deployment Monitoring
Watch for:
1. GitHub webhook trigger in Coolify
2. Build process completion (2-4 minutes)
3. Container restart and health check
4. Site accessibility at new.memopyk.com
