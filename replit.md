2. Form data is validated and submitted to backend API
3. Contact information is stored in database with status tracking
4. Admin can view and manage contacts in admin panel
5. Status updates are tracked for lead management

### Video Content Flow
1. Admin uploads video URLs for hero carousel
2. Videos are organized by language (French/English URLs)
3. Carousel auto-advances every 8 seconds
4. Language switching changes displayed video content
5. Fallback images for slow connections

- July 08, 2025. ROOT CAUSE: Coolify deployment system not respecting custom nixpacks.toml configuration despite correct build_pack setting
- July 08, 2025. BREAKTHROUGH: Manual Start Command override in Coolify UI successfully bypassed configuration file issues
- July 08, 2025. DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS: Set "node dist/index.js" as Start Command in Coolify, deployment completed successfully

- July 08, 2025. SOLUTION IDENTIFIED: Need to set Build Command to "npm run build" in Coolify UI alongside Start Command
- July 08, 2025. CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Both build and start commands properly configured in Coolify but source code not being pulled from GitHub
- July 08, 2025. ROOT ISSUE: Container has no package.json or source files - GitHub repository synchronization failing in Coolify build process
- July 08, 2025. CRITICAL REALIZATION: Complete MEMOPYK application built locally but never committed/pushed to GitHub repository
- July 08, 2025. DEPLOYMENT FAILURE ROOT CAUSE: GitHub repository missing all application files - only contains outdated basic structure
- July 08, 2025. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Commit and push complete application (client/, server/, shared/, package.json, configs) to GitHub
- July 08, 2025. GITHUB SYNC ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Large media files (90MB+) causing GitHub push timeouts
- July 08, 2025. GITHUB SYNC FIXED: Removed large sample video files, successfully pushed complete application code

- July 08, 2025. CRITICAL FIX: Identified Dockerfile overriding nixpacks.toml - removed Dockerfile to enable working Vite build configuration
- July 08, 2025. VITE BUILD SOLUTION: nixpacks.toml now contains NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false and npm install --include=dev for devDependencies
- July 08, 2025. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Dockerfile was in workspace and being copied to GitHub repository during deployment
- July 08, 2025. FINAL FIX: Removed Dockerfile from workspace and deployed clean application (98 files) with nixpacks.toml only
- July 08, 2025. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FIX: Corrected Supabase environment variable names to match available secrets (SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY)

- July 09, 2025. TOKEN AUTHENTICATION: Eliminated session/cookie complexity entirely with simple token-based auth system
- July 09, 2025. PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE: Server uses in-memory Set<string> for tokens, frontend uses localStorage with Bearer headers
- July 09, 2025. SIMPLIFIED AUTH: Removed Remember Me functionality for cleaner token-based authentication
- July 09, 2025. CLEAN DEPLOYMENT: Multiple forced deployments to ensure production container updates with token authentication
- July 09, 2025. CRITICAL LESSON: Build regression caused by moving server-needed tools (vite, esbuild) to devDependencies
- July 09, 2025. NIXPACKS FIX: Set NODE_ENV=development to ensure devDependencies install during build process
- July 09, 2025. POLICY ESTABLISHED: Never put server-needed build tools in devDependencies - production builds require them
- July 09, 2025. EFFICIENCY PROTOCOLS: Established clear build verification steps to prevent repeated deployment failures
- July 09, 2025. ROOT CAUSE: Multiple sequential mistakes from not verifying dependency changes before deployment
- July 09, 2025. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: User added NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false environment variable in Coolify to force devDependencies installation
- July 09, 2025. DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS: Container rebuilding with correct environment configuration to resolve vite/esbuild build failures
- July 09, 2025. FINAL SOLUTION: User updated Coolify build command from "npm run build" to "npm ci --include=dev && npm run build"

## User Preferences

```
Communication Style: Simple, everyday language that matches the user's language. Avoid technical terms, as users are non-technical.
GitHub Access: Full access via GITHUB_TOKEN - never make excuses about git operations being blocked.
Deployment Protocol: Always use selective file copying, never copy entire workspace to avoid Dockerfile/media contamination.
Build Tools Policy: NEVER put server-needed tools in devDependencies - they must be in regular dependencies for production builds.
Efficiency Focus: Work independently for extended periods, only return with complete solutions or genuine blockers.
```

## GitHub Deployment Protocol

### Critical Rules
1. **Token Authority**: GITHUB_TOKEN provides full repository access - use it confidently
2. **Selective Copying**: Only copy essential application files, never entire workspace
3. **Clean State**: Always remove Dockerfile, media files, node_modules before deployment  
4. **Verification**: Verify clean state before git operations
5. **Force Push**: Use --force to ensure clean repository state

### Standard Deployment Files
- client/, server/, shared/ directories
- package.json, vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js
- tsconfig.json, drizzle.config.ts, components.json, nixpacks.toml
- .gitignore, Stephane.txt

### Files to ALWAYS Exclude
- Dockerfile (conflicts with nixpacks.toml)
- client/public/media (large files cause timeouts)
- node_modules (never commit dependencies)
- dist (never commit build outputs)
